        Beyond the buzz of Ralph loops, GSD and deep agent frameworks<sup>1</sup>, it
        is hard to go on LinkedIn in 2026 and not be force fed articles on the
        impact of AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        This most recent change does feel different, with some describing this
        as the first look at AGI. Stories such as that of a Shopify CEO 'one
        shotting' some MRI software<sup>2</sup>, and my own experience with using CLI
        Vibe Coding tools has made it hard to maintain skepticism on the quality
        of AI code output.<sup>3,4</sup>

        Just like every generational transformation, a world of virtually
        unlimited on demand code will change the nature of how value is created
        and captured by businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is not just important for AI nerds like myself, it matters to every
        person and business who buys and uses software.
      </p>

      <p>
        Across multiple articles, I aim to explore the impact of AI on the
        software industry. What is makes a company/product defensible now? What
        should procurement and investors be aware of in their valuations? And
        why might businesses make irrational decisions despite this?

        <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> On-demand AI code generation and vibe
        coding tools are eroding traditional software moats. Features that once
        took months to build can now be produced in hours—fundamentally shifting
        the build vs buy equation for businesses. This changes how SaaS
        companies create value, how procurement teams should evaluate software
        subscriptions, and how investors should approach software defensibility
        in due diligence. This is the first in a series exploring what's
        actually defensible in the AI era, and what it means for anyone who
        buys, builds, or invests in software.
