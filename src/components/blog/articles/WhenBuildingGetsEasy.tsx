      <p>
        The first thing you realise after building using AI… is that any of the
        hundreds of millions of people using AI can build the exact same thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quality of AI coding tools has improved conceptually, to the point
        where it can really no longer be considered 'Vibe Coding"; implying that
        the human does all the planning and the agent just outputs text. We now
        have agents that can plan, architect, debug, design, and interact with
        complex codebases.<sup>1</sup> It is now better described as "AI Augmented
        Development" or "Vibe Development".
      </p>

      <p>
        Using AI tools is no longer limited to wannabe's such as myself who
        share their latest project via LinkedIn at http://localhost:3000, it is being
        used effectively by the best coders in the world on real projects.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        It got me thinking, that as Vibe-developing capability increases, what
        moats exist for new and established software products?
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditionally, companies would be able to build out proprietary
        codebases. The features this codebase creates add product value to
        customers, Company gets more customers who pay more money.
      </p>

      <p>
        This used to be a defensible business model, for a number of reasons:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Note: This list is not exhaustive.</em>
      </p>

      <h2>1. Effort to recreate - Accumulated Complexity</h2>

      <p>
        Creating code was bottlenecked by human processing. A sophisticated
        feature might represent thousands of hours of engineering time. Even if
        a competitor knew <em>what</em> you'd built, recreating it meant hiring
        expensive engineers and waiting months or years.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a world where AI capability rapidly increases development output,
        products can accumulate complexity and features at a pace that might
        soon be able to keep up with an incumbent company, with less overheads.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Talent Scarcity</h2>

      <p>
        The people who <em>could</em> build these systems were rare and
        expensive. Companies that attracted top engineering talent could execute
        on ideas that others simply couldn't staff for.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI augmented development will not only increase the capability of
        existing developers, and reduce the bottleneck of human processing, but
        it actually removes barriers for people to enter the market, in the same
        way that drag and drop software opened up doors for many. (More on this
        in future articles)
      </p>

      <h2>3. Intellectual Property Law</h2>

      <p>
        Patents, trade secrets, and copyright created legal barriers around
        implementation details. Even if someone could theoretically rebuild your
        system, they risked litigation. This gave companies time to establish
        market position while competitors either licensed the technology or
        worked around it.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI does not remove this barrier, but ideas are harder to patent, and the
        software industry has always been an interesting legal area for IP. For
        example, what code is proprietary, and what is simply the obvious way to
        implement a well-understood function? The Oracle v. Google case spent a
        decade litigating whether <em>APIs themselves</em> could be copyrighted.
        The answer was murky at best.
      </p>

      <p>
        AI makes this murkier. When AI generates code, it's not copying your
        implementation, it's producing functionally equivalent output from a
        statistical understanding of how software works. You can't sue someone
        for independently arriving at the same solution, and that's essentially
        what AI-assisted development enables at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moat was never really the code. It was the institutional knowledge
        required to write it. That's what's evaporating.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Product Hegemony - Usability through network effect</h2>

      <p>
        Microsoft for example built it's early hegemony in software by becoming
        the no-brainer platform for early micro-processor and PC development,
        becoming the platform that everybody used, and new how to use.<sup>3</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        AI presents the possibility of a user interface which can be fully
        customisable in terms of its capability, and usability. Why would any
        business or user turn to horizontal or generic software, when they could
        have a fully customised version, down to a user level?<sup>4</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>
          (Note, This is in reference to the Microsoft business model in the
          very early days, not today)
        </em>
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>
        All of this accumulates to put pressure on SaaS providers as the
        sellers. With the price of software development down, It now affords
        businesses and consumers options to:
      </p>

      <div className="bg-coral/10 border border-coral/30 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
        <p className="!mt-0">
          <strong>A.</strong> Replace subscriptions with a cheaper new entrant
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>B.</strong> Build the software or elements of it themselves<sup>5</sup>
        </p>

        <p className="!mb-2">Or</p>

        <p className="!mb-0">
          <strong>C.</strong> Use the leverage created by those options to
          negotiate a better contract.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>The same equation exists in the M&A space in company valuation.</p>

      <p>
        For enterprises who place a premium on reliability, security, or have
        complex existing integrations, this equation might not make sense yet.
        But looking ahead to the future, I can only see the capability of
        vibe-developing increasing.
      </p>

      <p>
        None of this means software companies disappear overnight. The strong
        ones built moats around things other than code—data, distribution,
        trust, relationships. (I'll dig into these in future articles.) What's
        changing is how much time code complexity alone actually buys you.
      </p>

      <p>
        People inside the industry probably know this already. But for the
        businesses and consumers still operating like software is scarce:{" "}
        <strong>
          The power dynamic has shifted, and it's shifting in your favour.
        </strong>
